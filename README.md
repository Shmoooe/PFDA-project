# PFDA-project

This repository contains my project for the module Programming For Data Analytics (PFDA).

Author: Joanna Kelly

I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to complete my project and the language used was [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

The website from which I took my dataframes was [data.gov.ie](https://data.gov.ie/organization/meteireann)

The outline of my repository is as follows:

1. [Dataframes](https://github.com/Shmoooe/PFDA-project/tree/main/dataframes)
    This contains the raw Met Ã‰ireann files I downloaded and renamed for my own legibilty
    - belmullet_mayo.csv
    - dublin.csv
    - malin.csv
    - mullingar.csv
    - roches_point.csv
2. [.gitignore](https://github.com/Shmoooe/PFDA-project/blob/main/.gitignore)
    Ignores files that are produced by Python.
3. [README.md](https://github.com/Shmoooe/PFDA-project/blob/main/README.md)
4. [ireland.csv](https://github.com/Shmoooe/PFDA-project/blob/main/ireland.csv)
    This is my combined data frame. I left it on my main page as it is the principle csv file in this project.
5. [windspeeds.ipynb](https://github.com/Shmoooe/PFDA-project/blob/main/windspeeds.ipynb)
    This is the Jypter notebook that contains all of my work, including code, visuals, data analysis and comments.
